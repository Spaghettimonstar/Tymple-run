# Tymple raid
A typing game about evading traps and obstacles by typing words out.


Concept
Basic gist:Player loads into game, and the character automatically starts running. Randomly, traps will pop up either with the associated word(Spikes, pitfall, boulder, etc), an associated word(Points, Hole, Rock), or random words assigned to traps. If the player types the word in time(Or correctly?), the player will dodge the trap. If reaction function  is added, players will need to type the words associated with the trap to observe it successfully, and then need to type words or hold letters(after typing) to avoid dying.

Traps
Spikes[Words generated; Spines, Points, Sharp, iron, Spikes]
Pitfall[Words generated; Hole, Pothole, Pitfall, abyss, drop, missing, trip]
Boulder[Words generated;Boulder,rock,big,stone,bedrock,rock debris]
Arrows[Arrow,flying,feather,stick,Spine,dart,bolt]
Tripwire[Tripwire, string, trap, hazard, surprise, unexpected]
Snakes[Slithering, Snakes, Serpent, Strike, Hungry, Writhing,venom]

Lever [Switch, lever, interact, bridge, signal, pull]
“Boss” level
Parkour→ Platforms will randomly generate upon entering the  boss room every 10 traps, and random words will be inscribed on them. Players have to type the words pretty fast(increase compared to other traps), otherwise the platforms the player is on(visibly shaking, shaking increases over time to signify time running out) will fall and the player will die.
